        <p class="article">&emsp;&emsp;The 1920’s saw a major rise in the amount of organized crime. Street gangs had been around for a few decades, but none of the crimes committed were on the same level as when prohibition went into effect. This created an entryway for gangsters, because while they didn’t know very much about how business worked, most of them carried a gun and could be used to help protect illegal bars. Eventually they were collecting large amounts of money, and they had to learn more about business as well as hiring lawyers. The power dynamic shifted, where the mobsters were now giving orders to their former bosses.

        <p class="article">&emsp;&emsp;There was so much illegal activity regarding alcohol during the time that the government created the Federal Prohibition Bureau. This was meant to help catch people distributing alcohol, but with a large area to cover and so many people in the network, police could only confiscate about 5% of all alcohol.
