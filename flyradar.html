        <p class="article">&emsp;&emsp;When we discuss legitimate business, we're talking about business practices in the 1920s that would have been accepted as legal today. Many businesses were legal for their time, but today their practices would be criminal. To be frank, the only business that would be on stable legal and moral ground would be small-scale businesses like family-run stores or family-run farms. Besides those small exceptions, all of the markets of the 1920s had its fair share of shady practices and immoral business plans.

        <p class="article">&emsp;&emsp;Illegitimate business was a broad spectrum as we look back because some of what was being done then was illegal even for the respective time period.  There were many conventional businesses that took advantage of the little laws set in place for workers and did what was the best for margins and for the company. This included minimal safety for the workers, no health plan and you could be fired without warning. Other ways of making money legitimately included literal crime as well. The 1920’s saw a major rise in the amount of organized crime. Street gangs had been around for a few decades, but none of the crimes committed were on the same level as when prohibition went into effect. This created an entryway for gangsters, because while they didn’t know very much about how business worked, most of them carried a gun and could be used to help protect illegal bars. Eventually, they were collecting large amounts of money, and they had to learn more about business as well as hiring lawyers. The power dynamic shifted, where the mobsters were now giving orders to their former bosses.

        <p class="article">&emsp;&emsp;There was so much illegal activity regarding alcohol during the time that the government created the Federal Prohibition Bureau. This was meant to help catch people distributing alcohol, but with a large area to cover and so many people in the network, police could only confiscate about 5% of all alcohol. Part of the reason this number was so low was because the biggest offenders could simply pay off the authorities, and this allowed gangsters to do as they pleased. Crime was rampant, and monetarily it made sense to do what most businesses did back then, but it was by no means moral.
