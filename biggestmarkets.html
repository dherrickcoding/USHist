    <p class="article">&emsp;&emsp;At the start of the 1920’s, the United States was coming out of an intense period of uncertainty. They had recently come out of a World War, and had been in an influenza pandemic for a few years. People had been feeling very anxious, and many were looking for ways to distract themselves from it all. Fortunately (or ultimately unfortunately), the 1920’s brought a recently popularized idea: a credit line.</p>
    <p class="article">&emsp;&emsp;Any person could “borrow” money, as long as they paid the money back with added interest.  In the average consumer’s mind, this meant that they could virtually spend as much money as they wanted. People started buying more and more things using credit, which created sort of an economic “boom”. But the thing that most didn’t realize was how much debt they had accrued until it was too late to come back from it, and the economy crashed in the 1930’s.
    </p>
    <p class="article">&emsp;&emsp;Due to this false boom however, consumerism rose greatly and there were much more opportunities to create a new market for products. If a product was advertised well, it would sell well because of the mindset of buyers at the time. This caused a spike in the market of accommodations rather than necessities, such as:</p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Mass Communication</li>
        <li>Food & Beverages</li>
        <li>Automotives</li>
        <li>Electric Household Devices</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="article">&emsp;&emsp;There was much less worry about budgeting because of the invention of a credit line, and people were looking for ways to cope from recent events. Another way people were coping was by drinking alcohol, but prohibition had gone into effect a few years into the 20’s. Prohibition caused a massive spike in the amount of alcohol distributed, and was one of the biggest markets at the time due to its illegality.</p>
