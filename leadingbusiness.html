       <h2 class="bizown">Al Capone</h2>
       <br>
       <p class="article">&emsp;&emsp;Al Capone was one of the most infamous gangsters of the 20th Century, raking in hundreds of millions of dollars per year from bootlegging, gambling, and prostitution. He was the biggest suspect in the Saint Valentine’s Day Massacre of 1929, in which seven of his rivals were murdered. Capone was ultimately convicted for tax evasion in 1931 and sentenced to 11 years in prison, which was a rather anticlimactic end to someone known for committing much worse crimes. The reason Capone wasn’t tried for his other crimes was that he had paid so many people to keep quiet, that it was easier to convict him of tax evasion. He eventually died of cardiac arrest on January 21st, 1947.</p>

       <h2 class="bizown">Henry Ford</h2>
       <br>
       <p class="article">&emsp;&emsp;Henry Ford started his career working for  Edison Illuminating Company while developing his first horseless carriage in the shed behind his home, and in 1903 he quit his job to start the ford motor company with his design. He started building his reputation and started to build his business. He made the car available to the middle class with reduced prices next to the competitors, with the sale level of craftsmanship. Another note to add about ford was his decision in 1914 to double his workers pay to over double minimum wage. This was not just a charitable play however, this design made sure that his employees were inspired to work their hardest and do the best job they could. Ford wasn't perfect, but he was better than most and set a wonderful precedent in the motorcar industry.</p>

       <h2 class="bizown">Abner Zwillman</h2>
       <br>
       <p class="article">&emsp;&emsp;Abner Zwillman was a New Jersey mob boss involved in bootlegging and gambling, but he tried very hard to make his businesses appear as though they were legitimate. He would make many donations to make himself seem like an honest and good person. He started his career in crime when prohibition was put into effect and started smuggling alcohol into New Jersey from Canada. Zwillman used the money he got from smuggling to start other underground operations as well as a few legitimate businesses to help him appear as a real businessman. He took over Dutch Shultz’ criminal operations in 1935 following his murder, and came to be know as the “Al Capone of New Jersey” although he still made attempts to seem legitimate. He quickly became involved in local politics and ended up controlling most of Newark’s politicians for almost twenty years. In 1959, Zwillman was found hanged shortly before his expected appearance in the McClellan Senate Committee hearings. The death was ruled a suicide, however bruises found on his wrists suggested he had been tied up and murdered. </p>

       <h2 class="bizown">Robert Woodruff</h2>
       <br>
       <p class="article">&emsp;&emsp;Robert Woodruff was educated at Georgia Military Academy and attended Emory University from 1908 to 1909. After being let go from Emory, he became a machinist's apprentice and then salesman at General Fire Extinguisher Company. Having proven himself an accomplished salesman, his father hired him as a salesman and buyer for his Atlantic Ice Company in 1911. After young Woodruff began negotiating with Walter White, head of White Motor Company, to purchase thirty trucks to replace the horse-drawn delivery wagons used by his father's company. Upon hearing of this, an irritated Ernest Woodruff fired his son, but right after White hired him as a salesman for White Motor. Woodruff rapidly climbed the ranks as he proved himself to be the firm's top truck salesman. In 1919 he was named vice-president and general manager, serving in that position until 1923.</p>
       <p class="article">&emsp;&emsp;Around this time, Ernest along with a syndicate of businessmen bought the Coca-Cola Company for $25 million. Stock is sold for $40 a share, and Robert is among the investors, but by 1923 the company’s in trouble and they need a good leader. Robert is offered the job as president and he takes it with a severe pay cut, stating “I figured that if I ever brought the price of stock back to what I had paid for it, I’d sell and get even. Then I’d go back to selling cars and trucks”. Under Robert's leadership the company exponentially flourished with his high standards for quality and service. The company survived the Great Depression with rising profits every year, with the slogan “Everyone has a nickel” to spend on a Coke. By the late 1930s, Coca-Cola was a household name and bottling plants were operating in 44 countries. Robert was the president of Coca-Cola until 1954, and died in 1985 after a very full life.</p>
