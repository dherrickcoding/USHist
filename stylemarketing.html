        <p class="article">&emsp;&emsp;The 1920s brought new markets and things to advertise. With color printing as an option for advertisements, reinventing marketing became a must. Before complex marketing, a company focused on merely displaying their product, but the format changed to presenting the product instead. With more elaborate strategies than in prior decades, you could relate to a person's needs or desires and try to coax the consumer into purchasing a product with catchy phrases or must-have features;  Advertising truly became a game instead of a process. There were advertisements in your daily newspaper, there were billboard advertisements as you went to work, and for some, there were adverts in the workplace as well. On a more personal note, there were flyers and catalogs like the “Sears  & Roebuck Catalog” to purchase from, and when you got home after the workday there were advertisements on your radio.</p>
        <p class="article">&emsp;&emsp;One example of this innovation in marketing is the rivalry between Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola. Both drinks were invented around the 1890s, Coca Cola originally being marketed as a temperance drink. Pepsi was marketed as a product to help with dyspepsia (also known as indigestion), and was originally named “Brad’s Drink” after the owner, Caleb Bradham. Coke was quickly bought by Asa Griggs Candler, who helped the drink become extremely successful in the 20th century. Both companies used slogans such as Coke’s “Refresh Yourself” and “Pure as Sunlight”, and Pepsi’s “Delicious and Healthful” used after Barney Oldfield endorsed them.  Pepsi was very popular as well, but in 1923 the company entered bankruptcy due to increased sugar prices because of World War 1. From 1922-1933, the Coca-Cola company had multiple opportunities to buy out Pepsi but refused each time. If Coca-Cola had bought Pepsi-Cola, it could have eliminated its greatest competitor in the modern era.</p>
